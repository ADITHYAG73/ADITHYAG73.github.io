I am Adithya Giridharan, a passionate Data Scientist and GenAI Engineer currently working at Karini AI, with a strong background in RAG/GraphRAG systems, LLMs, and cloud technologies. I hold an MTech in Data Science and Analytics from IIIT Prayagraj and am actively pursuing PhD opportunities to advance my research in machine learning.

## Research Interests

My research interests lie at the intersection of:
- **Reinforcement Learning for Sports Analytics**: Exploring how RL can optimize game strategies and player performance analysis
- **Large Language Models**: Advancing RAG systems, agentic workflows, and multimodal AI applications  
- **Graph Machine Learning**: Leveraging knowledge graphs and graph neural networks for complex relationship modeling

## Professional Background

I bring practical experience from building production ML/AI systems at Mercedes Benz R&D and HSBC, with expertise in:
- End-to-end RAG/GraphRAG pipelines using Neo4j, OpenSearch, and AWS Bedrock
- LLM-based document processing and intelligent extraction systems
- Computer vision applications for automotive diagnostics
- Credit risk analytics and decision science applications

## Transition to Research

While my professional experience spans industry applications, I am passionate about transitioning to academic research to explore fundamental questions in ML/AI. My goal is to contribute to cutting-edge research while maintaining strong connections to practical applications.

I am actively seeking PhD opportunities where I can combine my technical expertise with rigorous research methodology to advance the field of machine learning.
